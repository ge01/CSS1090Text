    <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
    <p>This is an ordinary paragraph. Notice that this text is blue. The default text color for a page is defined in the body selector.</p>

    <h1>Heading 1 (center)</h1>
    <h2>Heading 2 (left)</h2>
    <h3>Heading 3 (right)</h3>

    <p>The three headings above are aligned center, left and right.</p>

    <h1>Example text-align: justify;</h1>

    <p>The text-align: justify; value stretches the lines so that each line has equal width (like in newspapers and magazines).</p>

    In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. 'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.'
